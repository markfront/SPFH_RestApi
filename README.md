## Introduction

This repository contains code to run SinglePageFullHtml (SPFH) (https://github.com/markfront/SinglePageFullHtml) as a restful service.

## Getting Started

### Clone/Compile/Package
```
$ git clone https://github.com/markfront/SPFH_RestApi.git
$ cd SPFH_RestApi
$ ./mvnw clean package
```

### Start the Service

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The service will be run on http://localhost:8080

### Call the Service

Enter the following in browser address bar or using GET method in Postman:
```
http://localhost:8080/fget?url=<url>
```

For example, http://localhost:8080/fget?url=https://www.wonderslist.com/10-most-amazing-places-on-earth

After about 10-30 seconds, you should see the result returned as JSON.


## Run the API As Docker Container

If you like to run the api as a docker, I have included the dockerfile to build a ubuntu docker image that includes everything. Here is how:

### Install Docker and Docker.io (if you haven't)

```
sudo apt-get install docker docker.io
```

### Build Docker Image
If this is the first time you build docker, you might want to first read this page: https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-create-docker-images-with-dockerfile

```
$ cd ~/git/SPFH_RestApi
$ docker build -f my-custom-ubuntu.dockerfile -t my-custom-ubuntu .
```
It will take a few minutes to build. When it succeeds, you should see something like:
```
Successfully built 73f1bc6fda8c
Successfully tagged my-custom-ubuntu:latest
```
Also you should see the built image by "docker image ls", something like this:
```
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-custom-ubuntu    latest              73f1bc6fda8c        21 minutes ago      1.28GB
```

### Start the Container

```
docker run -d -v /tmp:/tmp -p 8282:8080 my-custom-ubuntu
```
It will start the docker container named "my-custom-ubuntu" in the backend (as deamon by the option "-d"), hook the folder /tmp of your host machine to the folder /tmp of the docker (to store temporary file generated by the rest api which is running inside the docker). It will also hook the port 8282 of your host machine to the port 8080 exposed by the docker.

### Test the Api

Open a browser and enter the following in the address bar:
```
http://localhost:8282/fget?url=https://www.wonderslist.com/10-most-amazing-places-on-earth
```
Note the port number is 8282, which is what you specify when start the docker.

### Shutdown the Container

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
4ef2c1533bb6        my-custom-ubuntu    "/bin/sh -c 'cd git/…"   5 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds        0.0.0.0:8282->8080/tcp   eager_kirch

$ docker kill 4ef2c1533bb6
```

## Enjoy!
